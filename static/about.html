		We are taking back the term "Hacking" which has been soured in public mind. Hacking is an art form that uses something in a way in which it was not originally intended. This is highly creative activity that can be highly technical, simply clever, or both.
		Hackers bask in the glory of building it instead of buying it, repairing it rather than trashing it, and raiding their junk bins for new projects everytime they can steal a few moments away. <br>
